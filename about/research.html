<p> We are thrilled to launch the Southwest Virginia Clinical Research Registry! 
	This registry, in partnership with Carilion Clinic, Radford University, and Virginia Tec aims to support and accelerate clinical research 
	efforts in the region by connecting researchers with individuals interested in participating in studies focused on neurological health and 
	rehabilitation. Please consider joining the registry and supporing regional efforts in driving forward groundbreaking clinical research.</p>

<div class="title">
<span class="researchline">Educating Students on the Lived Brain Injury Experience</span> </div>
<p> In alignment with our lab’s mission to transform how brain injury is understood and treated, we are developing an interdisciplinary course 
	designed to help students explore the lived experience of brain injury. This course will bridge the gap between traditional engineering 
	education and the real-world complexities of neurorehabilitation. Students will engage directly with individuals living with brain injury, 
	their caregivers, and healthcare providers, gaining firsthand insight into the human, clinical, and technical challenges that shape 
	treatment and recovery. Through immersive experiences, stakeholder discussions, and reflective exercises, students will learn to design with 
	empathy, develop translational tools, and navigate the interdisciplinary nature of health-related science. Our goal is to cultivate engineers 
	and scientists who are not only technically skilled, but also deeply informed, compassionate, and ready to create impactful solutions that 
	meet the nuanced needs of people impacted by brain injury.</p>

<div class="title" >
<span class="researchline">Haptic Device Development for Clinical Assessments</span> </div>
<p> Our lab is developing a novel mechatronic system to improve the assessment of tactile perceptual impairments, particularly in individuals with 
	brain injury. Traditional assessment methodologies are often limited—they lack automation and sensing capabilities, are not compact, and are 
	incompatible with MRI environments, making them particularly unsuitable for evaluating individuals' post-stroke. To address these challenges, 
	we designed and developed an innovative, compact haptic device that delivers controlled high-resolution tactile stimuli while capturing real 
	time measurements of stimuli. This system enables objective, repeatable assessments while maintaining full MRI compatibility. By bridging gaps in 
	current clinical/research tools, this device will support more accurate assessment and could facilitate the development of personalized 
	rehabilitation strategies.</p>

<span class="researchline">Brain Neuroimaging for Stroke</span> </div>
<p> Our lab leverages advanced brain neuroimaging techniques to investigate how neurological injury impacts sensory processing and sensorimotor 
	integration. Using functional MRI (fMRI) and other non-invasive imaging methods, we study the dynamic interplay between brain activity and 
	tactile perception in both individuals who are neurotypical and those who have experienced stroke. By pairing neuroimaging data with 
	behavioral and physiological measures, we aim to identify neural signatures of impairment and recovery—ultimately informing more precise, 
	personalized rehabilitation strategies.</p>

<span class="researchline">Peripheral Nerve Signaling</span> </div>
<p> Our lab is investigating peripheral nerve function using threshold tracking techniques to better understand how sensory signals are transmitted 
	from the body to the brain. This approach allows us to quantify nerve excitability and conduction properties in real time, providing insight 
	into how peripheral signaling is altered following neurological injury, such as stroke. By examining changes in threshold dynamics, we aim 
	to uncover early indicators of sensory dysfunction and identify new therapeutic targets to support recovery and enhance functional 
	outcomes.</p>

<span class="researchline" id="adults">Sensorimotor Control in Adults and Individuals with Stroke</span> </div>

<p> Our main research direction is the investigation of sensorimotor impairments in individuals with stroke. We are primarily focused on 
	characterizing how stroke affects an individual's proprioception, and we are developing training protocols to rehabilitate the observed 
	impairments. Additionally, we are collaborating with experts in the area of motor control to investigate how stroke alters an individual's 
	movement by changing their arm's passive properties, eliciting hyperactive stretch reflex responses, causing weakness, and relying on 
	secondary motor pathways.</p>

<span class="researchline">Development of Sensorimotor Control</span> </div>

<p>One line of research that we are beginning to actively pursue is quantifying sensorimotor control capabilities in children as young as three years old. 
	For one unpublished line of work, we collected data from 51 children between the ages of three and six and eleven adults to investigate the 
	development of interaction forces/motions/behaviors when manipulating an instrumented joystick. We are currently advancing this line of 
	research by initiating new behavioral studies on related topics.<p>

<div class="title">
<hr style="border: 1px solid black;" id="haptic"/>
<span class="researchline"> Haptic Device Development, Customization, and Characterization</span> </div>

<p>An important aspect of our research is the development of mechatronic systems for use in our human subject experiments. Our experience in system 
	development runs the entire range of the creation process, beginning with development via CAD drawing, to the manufacturing of parts, 
	purchasing and assembling of commercial components, programming of communications between the system and user, characterization of the system, 
	and human subject testing. <p>

<hr style="border: 1px solid black;" id="substitution"/>
<span class="researchline"> Sensory Substitution</span> </div>

<p>A previous line of research was focused on improving motor functionality for upper-limb prosthesis users by providing proprioceptive information 
	using sensory substitution systems. Aligned with this aim, we tested the effectiveness of both custom and commercial tactile feedback devices 
	in relaying information artificially to various locations on the body. <p>
